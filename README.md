# Web_Scraping_Projects

## Movie_Theater_Showtimes:
This simple program allows a user to enter their zipcode into the command prompt. It then scrapes movie data from fandango.com that are showing in theaters close to where they live. When the program finishes running, it creates a dataframe which is converted into a csv file. The csv file contains the following movie data: Title, Rating, Runtime, Genre(s), Showtimes, and a Link to order tickets.


## NFL_Standings:
This program allows a user to analyze the information from a specific NFL regular season of their choice by entering they year they want and the location they would like the 'csv' file to be saved to. The information is scraped directly from the NFL.com website using Beautiful Soup. The information collected includes: Total Wins/Losses/Ties, Home & Away Wins/Losses/Ties, and Win Percentages.
